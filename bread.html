Bread is a staple food prepared from a dough of flour and water, usually by baking. Throughout
recorded history it has been popular around the world and is one of the oldest artificial foods,
having been of importance since the dawn of agriculture.

Proportions of types of flour and other ingredients vary widely, as do modes of preparation. As a
result, types, shapes, sizes, and textures of breads differ around the world. Bread may be
leavened by processes such as reliance on naturally occurring sourdough microbes, chemicals,
industrially produced yeast, or high-pressure aeration. Some bread is cooked before it can
leaven, including for traditional or religious reasons. Non-cereal ingredients such as fruits,
nuts and fats may be included. Commercial bread commonly contains additives to improve flavor,
texture, color, shelf life, and ease of manufacturing.

Bread is served in various forms at any meal of the day. It is eaten as a snack, and used as an
ingredient in other culinary preparations, such as sandwiches, and fried items coated in crumbs
to prevent sticking. It forms the bland main component of bread pudding, as well as of stuffings
designed to fill cavities or retain juices that otherwise might drip away.

Bread has a social and emotional significance beyond its importance as food. It plays essential
roles in religious rituals and secular culture. Its prominence in daily life is reflected in
language, where it appears in proverbs, colloquial expressions ("He stole the bread from my mouth"
), in prayer ("Give us this day our daily bread") and in the etymology of words, such as
"companion" (from Latin com "with" + panis "bread").


Etymology
The Old English word for bread was hlaf (hlaifs in Gothic: modern English loaf), which appears to
be the oldest Teutonic name. Old High German hleib and modern German Laib derive from this 
Proto-Germanic word, which was borrowed into Slavic (Polish chleb, Russian khleb) and Finnic (
Finnish leipä, Estonian leib) languages as well. The Middle and Modern English word bread appears
in Germanic languages, such as Frisian brea, Dutch brood, German Brot, Swedish bröd, and 
Norwegian and Danish brød; it may be related to brew or perhaps to break, originally meaning
"broken piece", "morsel".

History
Bread is one of the oldest prepared foods. Evidence from 30,000 years ago in Europe revealed
starch residue on rocks used for pounding plants. It is possible that during this time, starch
extract from the roots of plants, such as cattails and ferns, was spread on a flat rock, placed
over a fire and cooked into a primitive form of flatbread. Around 10,000 BC, with the dawn of the
Neolithic age and the spread of agriculture, grains became the mainstay of making bread. Yeast
spores are ubiquitous, including on the surface of cereal grains, so any dough left to rest
leavens naturally.

There were multiple sources of leavening available for early bread. Airborne yeasts could be
harnessed by leaving uncooked dough exposed to air for some time before cooking. Pliny the Elder
reported that the Gauls and Iberians used the foam skimmed from beer to produce "a lighter kind
of bread than other peoples." Parts of the ancient world that drank wine instead of beer used a
paste composed of grape juice and flour that was allowed to begin fermenting, or wheat bran
steeped in wine, as a source for yeast. The most common source of leavening was to retain a piece
of dough from the previous day to use as a form of sourdough starter, as Pliny also reported.

In 1961 the Chorleywood bread process was developed, which used the intense mechanical working of
dough to dramatically reduce the fermentation period and the time taken to produce a loaf. The
process, whose high-energy mixing allows for the use of lower protein grain, is now widely used
around the world in large factories. As a result, bread can be produced very quickly and at low
costs to the manufacturer and the consumer. However, there has been some criticism of the effect
on nutritional value.
